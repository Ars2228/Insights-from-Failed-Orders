# Insights-from-Failed-Orders
"Excited to share a project task from the data site Startasctrach! I recently completed the task 'Insights from Failed Orders' as part of the recruitment process for a Data Science position at Gett (formerly known as GetTaxi). The task involved investigating matching metrics for orders that did not complete successfully on Gett's platform. As a technology company solely focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management, Gett offers an application where clients can order taxis and drivers can accept their rides. It was a great learning experience and I am grateful to Vyas Adithya and Pathsetter for introducing this site. #datascience #recruitment #groundtransportationmanagement #Gett"
